			Who is God to you? What do you know about Him? Perhaps some of you are like me; dragged by
			their parents to church on Sundays. At a young age I knew of God based on what I learned at
			Sunday school. I know that God created the world, that He created man and woman, He opened up
			the Red sea, and saved Daniel from the lion's den. We know all these Bible stories.
		</p>

		<p class="text-xl font-semibold mb-6 text-center">But who is God?</p>

		<p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
			Jesus said that He is the only one who fully knows God; the only One who accurately
			understands the Father (Matthew 11:27). God has always been a mystery to me. God's "invisible
			qualities - his eternal power and divine nature - have been clearly seen (Romans 1:20)" in His
			creation, yet I still cannot seem to have a full grasp of who God is. Surely, I cannot see
			God, yet I feel so loved by Him. I cannot see God, yet He gives me peace that transcends all
			things, hope that never disappoints, provisions that overflow and love that satisfies. We can
			all learn something new about God every single day.

			When I get asked questions such as, How do I stop my porn addiction? How do I stop engaging in
			gossip? How do I stop judging others? How do I stop cursing? How can I forgive when it's hard?
			My answer to these questions is simple. Fall in love with God.
		</p>

		<p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
			When you pour your energy into stopping yourself from sinning, you are still trying to rid
			yourself of the sin/addiction by your own strength. Instead, pour your energy into reading
			your bible, praying daily, and fellowshipping with other followers of Christ. By doing this,
			you are allowing the Holy Spirit to work in you. The more you do this daily and consistently,
			the more you will fall in love with God, and the more encounters you will have with Him. God
			CAN deliver and restore you, even if you are the worst of sinners (2 Chronicles 7:14).
		</p>

		<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
			So I encourage you today to draw near to God. Call unto the Lord, and let Him reveal His
			wonderful mysteries to you.
